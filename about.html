                   Anthroponyms are not just a means of identifying people; 
                   they are deeply embedded in history, culture, and identity.
                    Understanding anthroponyms involves looking at the linguistic, 
                    social, cultural, and historical factors that shape names
                     and how they function in various societies. Through 
                     the study of personal names, one can learn much about 
                     a culture’s values, priorities, and the evolution of 
                     social structures over time.<br>
                     The origin and history of names are rich and complex, reflecting the evolution of human societies, languages, and cultures over time. Names serve not only as identifiers but also as carriers of meaning, cultural values, and familial or social histories. The study of the origin and history of names is known as onomastics. Here's an overview of how names have developed and evolved throughout history:
